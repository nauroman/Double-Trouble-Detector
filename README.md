# Double-Trouble-Detector
A double-clicks mouse button detector

Click your mouse button and let us detect if your mouse is malfunctioning. Rattling occurs when a broken mouse button sends unintended extra clicks, leading to double clicks when you only meant to click once. Too many double clicks? It might be time for a new mouse!
